How are Fein violins and violas made?  All handcrafted violins start with years of study of Antonius Stradivarius' instruments. 
Every handmade violin that we offer has been cut from aged, high altitude Spruce for the top, and rare, high altitude Maple for the back, sides, and neck. 
The fingerboard is cut from premium quality black ebony. 
We make sure the pegs, chin rest, and tailpiece match the beauty of the violin with fine quality fittings. 
We have Pernambuco violin bows, viola bows, and cello bows, as well as some fine carbon bows.
